These are the brief notes for the material presented in the **Programming & computing skills** session
at the **2025 STFC Summer School in Solar and Solar-terrestrial Physics**.
The aspirational objective of the course is to use Python to create a plot that resembles the
[WSA Enlil Solar Wind dashboard](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/products/wsa-enlil-solar-wind-prediction)
at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA's) Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC).

Along the way, we'll discuss not just how to use some major third-party Python libraries for scientific analysis
but also focus on how you can use online and built-in resources to find out how to use them yourself.

The course starts with a brief recap of some Python syntax and features but I recommend you also
go through the Software Carpentry's [Plotting and Programming in Python](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/) course for additional detail.
I'll refer to those notes for additional detail when I think it's relevant.
These notes are intended to start as the minimum the instructors require to deliver the course, which will mostly be live-coded.
