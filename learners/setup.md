## Data Sets

SWPC provides the latest WSA-Enlil snapshot in [this remote folder](https://nomads.ncep.noaa.gov/pub/data/nccf/com/wsa_enlil/prod/),
linked from the "Data" tab of the dashboard.  Go to that folder, click on the oldest date,
and download the file with a name that ends `.suball.nc`.  It should be about 130MB in size.

### Details

Setup for different systems can be presented in dropdown menus via a `spoiler`
tag. They will join to this discussion block, so you can give a general overview
of the software used in this lesson here and fill out the individual operating
systems (and potentially add more, e.g. online setup) in the solutions blocks.
